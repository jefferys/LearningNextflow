# LearningNextflow

This is a personal repo where I am trying to learn how to run Nextflow.

It is likely full of errors until I know better, and there is no guarantee I will fix them after I do. However, it is licensed under the same terms as Nextflow (currently Apache 2.0), should it be useful to anyone.
